The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model was implemented to generate synthetic Fashion MNIST images through a two-component architecture: a generator and a discriminator. The model was trained to produce realistic fashion item images by minimizing the adversarial loss between these components, showcasing progressive improvements in image quality and model performance over 20 epochs.
# Methodology

## Data Preparation
- Loaded the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow Datasets.
- Visualized the data to understand the images and their labels.

## Applied preprocessing steps:
Scaled images to a range of [0, 1].
Cached the dataset to speed up access.
Shuffled the dataset to ensure randomization.
Binned the data into batches of 128 images and prefetched to optimize performance.

## Model Architecture
Generator:
Created a Sequential model with Dense, Reshape, UpSampling2D, and Conv2D layers.
Designed to take random input values and generate images in the same format as the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Output shape: (28, 28, 1) to match the image dimensions.

Discriminator:
Created a Sequential model with Conv2D, LeakyReLU, Dropout, and Dense layers.
Designed to classify images as real or fake.
Output shape: (1,) for binary classification.
Training Setup

Loss Functions:
Used Binary Crossentropy for both generator and discriminator losses.

Optimizers:
Adam optimizer with different learning rates for generator and discriminator.

Custom Model Class:
Created a FashionGAN class subclassing tf.keras.Model.
Implemented custom training loop to update both the generator and discriminator.

Callback:
Developed a ModelMonitor callback to save generated images at the end of each epoch.

## Training Process
Trained the GAN for 20 epochs.
Monitored losses and generated images periodically to evaluate the training progress.

## Results
Training Losses:
Discriminator Loss (d_loss): Started at 0.5911 and generally decreased over epochs, stabilizing around 0.2675 to 0.3128.
Generator Loss (g_loss): Began at 0.6832 and decreased steadily, indicating the generator's improvement in producing realistic images.

Generated Images:
The ModelMonitor callback saved generated images at the end of each epoch. These images were evaluated to assess the quality of the generator's output.
Images showed progressive improvement in realism, although variations and imperfections were present due to the nature of GAN training.

## Model Summary:

Generator:
Total Parameters: 2,155,137
Architecture involved layers that progressively upsample and refine image quality.

Discriminator:
Total Parameters: 1,113,345

Architecture designed to classify images as real or fake through multiple convolutional layers and dropout for regularization.
The training results demonstrate the typical behavior of GANs where both generator and discriminator losses improve over time, indicating learning and adjustment. The visual quality of generated images also improved with more epochs, reflecting the modelâ€™s ability to create more realistic samples.
